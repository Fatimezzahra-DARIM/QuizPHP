# QuizPHP Application  
  
***Context of the project:***  
The solution we propose is to develop a web application  
which contains a PHP question bank to test technical knowledge.  
  
***Requirements:***  

User can see the three levels of the web application (Information, Questionnaire and Result), "Stepper Component".  
The user can see a progress counter that checks the percentage of the quiz, "ProgressBar Component".  
The user must have the quiz questions randomly.  
The user can only move on to the next question after answering the previous one.  
The user can see his result towards the end of the test.
